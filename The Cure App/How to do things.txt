Set the info in the package.json file

Then next type npm i

Feel free to edit any files, I suggest for now unless you need to edit the users files or anything then don't change the index.js file and don't change preload.js.

To run the app use 'npm start' in the root folder. Not the src folder. DON'T rename that folder as it will break the imports.

Type 'rs' in the terminal when the app is running to refresh

To export run 'npm run make', it will take a while to export so just leave it. It will output the location that the file is saved after it is done.

When you are finished, remove or comment out the line that says 'mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();' to prevent dev tools opening.

Put all scripts in script.js or add another file, just don't put anything in preload.js becasue that file works strangly and it's confusing to explain.

Change file loaded by running this js `window.location.href = './jeff.html';` then odc change 'jeff.html' to the correct file.
If you want a specific dir then you can do like './pages/cool_pages/jef.html'
